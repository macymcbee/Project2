        <h1>Clarity in design leads to a flawless experience.</h1>
        <p>As a UX designer, I love the ability to work on complex problems and simplifying these problems into solutions that work for any and all users. I'm very focused on designing the different connection points going from one screen to another and all the different ways that the app could flow.</p>
